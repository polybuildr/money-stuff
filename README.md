# Analysing topics from Matt Levine's "Money Stuff"

There exists a fantastic newsletter called Money Stuff which can be found at https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/authors/ARbTQlRLRjE/matthew-s-levine and the author can be found on Twitter at https://twitter.com/matt_levine.

Recently, I was idly wondering about the topics that Matt Levine writes about in Money Stuff and how they reflect trends in Finance news, in some way. I had some free time on my hands, hence this exploratory respository.

There will be a longer blog post about this on my blog at https://blog.vghaisas.com.
